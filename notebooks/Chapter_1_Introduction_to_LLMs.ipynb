    "# Chapter 1: Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionising natural language processing (NLP) by enabling machines to understand and generate human-like text. This chapter introduces the foundational concepts, architectures, and practical applications of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you will:\n",
    "- Understand what Large Language Models are and their importance in NLP.\n",
    "- Learn about the transformer architecture, the backbone of modern LLMs.\n",
    "- Explore real-world applications of LLMs.\n",
    "- Gain hands-on experience with basic tokenisation.\n",

    "## 1. What are Large Language Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are neural networks trained on extensive datasets to perform language-related tasks such as text generation, summarisation, translation, and question answering. Examples of popular LLMs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: Developed by OpenAI.\n",
    "- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Developed by Google.\n",
    "- **LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)**: Developed by Meta.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scalability**: Ability to process and generate large volumes of text.\n",
    "2. **Contextual Understanding**: Use attention mechanisms to understand text contextually.\n",
    "3. **Pre-trained Models**: Fine-tuned on specific tasks after being pre-trained on general datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Transformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformer architecture, introduced in the paper *Attention is All You Need*, is the foundation of modern LLMs. Key components include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attention Mechanism**: Helps the model focus on relevant parts of the input text.\n",
    "2. **Encoder-Decoder Structure**:\n",
    "   - The encoder processes the input text.\n",
    "   - The decoder generates the output text.\n",
