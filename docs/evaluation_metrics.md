# Evaluation Metrics for Assessing Large Language Models (LLMs)

Evaluation metrics are essential for understanding the performance of LLMs across different tasks, especially in areas where accuracy, relevance, and efficiency are critical.

### 1. Perplexity

**Definition**: Perplexity measures how well a language model predicts a sequence of words. It’s calculated as the exponent of the average negative log probability of each word in a sequence.

**Purpose**: Lower perplexity values indicate that the model is more confident in its predictions, making perplexity a common metric in language generation tasks.

**Example Calculation**:
If a model assigns probabilities to a sentence like "The cat sat on the mat" as follows:
- P(The) = 0.2
- P(cat) = 0.1
- P(sat) = 0.3
- etc.
The perplexity would be calculated based on the overall sequence probability.

### 2. BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)

**Definition**: BLEU score measures the similarity between a generated text and reference text(s). It’s commonly used for translation tasks.

**Purpose**: BLEU compares n-grams (short sequences of words) between the generated and reference texts to gauge how well they match. Higher BLEU scores indicate better performance in generating accurate, relevant text.

**Example**:
If the generated sentence is "The cat is on the mat" and the reference sentence is "The cat sat on the mat," BLEU would evaluate the overlap of matching phrases.

### 3. ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)

**Definition**: ROUGE is a set of metrics used to assess the quality of text summarisation by comparing n-grams, word sequences, and word pairs between the generated and reference summaries.

**Purpose**: ROUGE is especially useful in summarisation tasks, where it evaluates both precision and recall.

**Common Variants**:
- **ROUGE-1**: Overlap of unigrams (single words)
- **ROUGE-2**: Overlap of bigrams (two-word pairs)
- **ROUGE-L**: Measures longest matching sequences

### 4. F1 Score

**Definition**: F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, often used in classification tasks. Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall assesses how well the model identifies all relevant items.

**Purpose**: The F1 Score is essential for evaluating LLMs that perform tasks involving classification, such as sentiment analysis.

**Example Calculation**:
If a model classifies 10 relevant texts correctly out of 15 actual positive examples, and incorrectly classifies 5 irrelevant texts as positive, the F1 Score balances precision and recall.

### 5. Accuracy

**Definition**: Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions made by the model, calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.

**Purpose**: Accuracy is a straightforward metric that provides a quick overview of model performance, but it may not be the best choice for imbalanced datasets.

### 6. Latency

**Definition**: Latency measures the time it takes for a model to generate a response, from the time it receives an input to the output generation.

**Purpose**: For real-time applications, latency is crucial to ensure that the model responds quickly and doesn’t cause delays.

**Example**: In a chatbot application, low latency ensures smooth interactions and a better user experience.

### 7. Model Size and Memory Efficiency

**Definition**: These metrics assess the model’s storage requirements and memory usage during inference.

**Purpose**: For deploying LLMs on edge devices or resource-constrained environments, memory efficiency and model size are critical factors.
