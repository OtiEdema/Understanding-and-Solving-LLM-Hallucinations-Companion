# Understanding and Solving LLM Hallucinations: A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to the **Understanding and Solving LLM Hallucinations** repository! This repository is a companion to the book of the same name, which delves into the causes, impacts, and mitigation techniques for hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides practical implementations, exercises, and tools to help AI practitioners, researchers, and enthusiasts understand and build better-performing LLMs.

## üìñ About the Book

Large Language Models have revolutionised Natural Language Processing (NLP) by enabling machines to generate and understand text in a human-like manner. However, these models are prone to hallucinations‚Äîgenerating plausible-sounding but incorrect or fabricated outputs. This repository provides:

- Practical examples for identifying and mitigating hallucinations.
- Code for experiments discussed in the book.
- Tools and techniques for improving LLM performance.
- A roadmap for building ethical and memory-efficient LLM applications.
